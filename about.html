        <p class="greeting">Hello!</p>

        <p>Welcome to my website.</p>

        <p>
          I am an educator and designer specializing in lighting, scenery, and
          projections. Originally from Chicago, I received my bachelors in
          design and directing from Illinois State University.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spent many years based in New York City and travelling the world
          designing every possible type of production you can imagine including
          theater, opera, dance, concerts, houses of worship, fashion shows,
          retail stores, and what I am pretty sure was a cult meeting-- ask me
          about it, it is a weird but funny story.
        </p>

        <p>
          After a long time on the east coast, I got back to my midwest roots
          and am currently in my final year as an MFA candidate at Indiana
          University-Bloomington with a focus on design pedagogy.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my precious free time, I enjoy cooking (my hummus is amazing and
          Iâ€™d love to make it for you!), going to trivia bars, bike riding,
          flower arranging, making obscure references to old tv shows, and
          taking way too many pictures of my dog.
        </p>

        <p>
          I live in Bloomington, IN with my wife Emily, our dog Carl, and cat
          Madison.
        </p>

        <p>I bet you have a fun project coming up; we should talk!</p>
